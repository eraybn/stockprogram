Program Introduction
First, a database with the same name as the database is opened in our rental automation,
Then the database in our file is imported to the file we opened.

The XAMPP program is run for connections.
MySql is started.
MySql is found and run from the computer menu and the localhost connection is approved.
The Visual Studio project file is opened and started.

I made it using Visual Studio 2015, mysql and C# language.
